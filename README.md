# UFOs

## Overview of Project: 
With added filters for searching multiple criteria, we are determining if the website will attract repeat users for UFO research.

## Results:

- A warning that the current data used for this webpage is far limited in comparison to what’s planned. The dataset covers January 1 through January 13, 2010, and only in the United States. Type in a later date (see below) and there will not be a result.

- At this time, the search works mostly by entering one item for filtering, then another, but only if results show after the first filter. If you search for the city of Fresno, you will get one result (for now) and so you do not need to filter out shapes or anything else. If you search for the city of San Diego, you get multiple results, and can then sort for something else within those. [san diego]

## Summary: 

- The web page works, and may help a few UFO enthusiasts (or sceptics) but the drawback to the site, which may lose audience, is the strict formatting of the filters. Currently a user has to try different attempts to pull anything they might want to find, only to learn that they capitalized their states search (since that is the norm) or the shape they want described is not exactly the same word they would think of.
- A drop-down menu, especially for states and countries, is recommended. These are mostly fixed-keywords, and can even expand to territory codes, such as those under the United States listings. These can be placed the top of the filter to suggest the search parameters to the user so that they have an easier starting place.
- Also, depending on the data source, if the webpage cannot work with different formatting, such as capitalization, there should be better notation and instructions on working the filters. This will warn the user that the data is formatted in a specific manner, and keyword searches are not going to work the same as on other sites. The webpage can explain that the data is more ‘raw,’ and therefore more attractive, to the site’s visitors.
